## Bonjour!

### What is the project about?
Activity patterns of neurons have so far been examined both singly and in pairs. Higher order interactions (HOIs), or non-pairwise interactions between neurons, are being studied in an effort to improve analysis . The type and quantity of information stored in groups (pairs or multiplets) in the brain is revealed by information about organisational structure (o-info). Various methods to optimise the o-info implementations in NumPy and Jax and integrating them with Frites will be included.

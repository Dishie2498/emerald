title: Optimization of Code
---
To insert highlight code inside of a post, it's enough to use some specific tags, has directly described into the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#code-snippet-highlighting). In this way the code will be included into a ``.highlight`` CSS class and will be highlight according to the [syntax.scss](https://github.com/mojombo/tpw/blob/master/css/syntax.css) file. This is the standard style adopted by **Github** to highlight the code.

## [jax.vmap()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html)
[```vmap```](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html) is a feature in JAX that enables efficient parallelization of functions over arrays or sequences of inputs.
- vmap stands for "vectorized map" and is a powerful feature that enables efficient parallelization of functions over arrays or sequences of inputs.
- With vmap, you can seamlessly apply a function to a batch of inputs, eliminating the need for explicit looping. This not only simplifies the code but also significantly improves performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex computations.

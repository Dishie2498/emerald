## [jax.vmap()](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html)
[```vmap```](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.vmap.html) is a feature in JAX that enables efficient parallelization of functions over arrays or sequences of inputs.
- vmap stands for "vectorized map" and is a powerful feature that enables efficient parallelization of functions over arrays or sequences of inputs.
- With vmap, you can seamlessly apply a function to a batch of inputs, eliminating the need for explicit looping. This not only simplifies the code but also significantly improves performance, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex computations.
